                        "Two-dimensional (2DMs) are thin materials with thickness
                        ranging from atomic to the nanometer scale that have attracted
                        considerable interest from the research community due to their
                        thermal, electrical, mechanical and optical properties, making
                        them great potential candidates for Thermal Management (TM)
                        based materials and for Thermo-Electric (TE) devices".
