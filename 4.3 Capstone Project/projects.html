                            Optimization of porosity parameters for a new range of dental implants, using data from CT scans to simulate fatiguerelationship between porosity and pore size and mechanical behavior. Finding the best set of parameters (Porosity and
                            pore size) for average life of each implant to be 10^8 cycles and making appropriate recommendations to the
                            manufacturer
