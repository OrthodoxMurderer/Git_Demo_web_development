            Experimental questions as what combination of Low dimensional Nanomaterials be used
            to achieve right balance of thermoelectric properties? Balance may mean the right balance
            of Figure of merit (ZT) and Power factor (PF) for such materials. Secondary questions
            such combinations can solve relate to Schottky Barrier Potentials, Shockley-Queisser
            Efficiency limit. Tertiary Questions relate to limits of phonon-electron transport in such
            combinations. For such, the existence of Hydrodynamic phonon and Ballistic transport
            relates to system size and system temperature. It has an ambiguous relationship with
            thermal conductivity k. Thermal conductivity k relationship with contribution of different
            phonon modes.

            Application research questions if solved by the above experimental goals will help realize
            a proof of concept and proof of design for some applications. The low dimensional
            materials (Graphene) based Field Effect Transistor (FET) for target specific sensing.
            Encapsulation for charge suppression or enhancement and carrier mobilities provides
            customizability to the functionality of the FET. It can be used for sensing organic and
            inorganic molecules. Band Structure and Electron-phonon transport will dictate the
            Material of choice for construction and the resultant back gate and drain voltages.
            Composites or superstructures can provide supplementary materials to todayâ€™s LithiumIon batteries. Potential Phononic Waveguides for enhanced photoexcitation and
            photovoltaic applications. Supercapacitors based on TDMCs.
